Hello you big beautitful bunch of braniacs,

It's nice to meet you. I'm Phoneixmaid (feel free to call me Phoe), 
I've always been curious about the behind the screen magic you all do so well. But never ventured further than looking at the curtain as a voice said "Dyslexics can't code"
Well no-one tells me what I can't do! so I'm here to learn and prove myself wrong.
